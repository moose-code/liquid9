# Liquid9

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Liquid9 is an alternative POL system that hosts a subscription period in which protocols deposit their native token while speculators deposit the pair token the protocol wishes to market make their native token against.

A dynamic discount is calculated based on how much capital is committed. Speculators end up purchasing discounted tokens subject to a vesting period
Bonus token rewards are built into the system to encourage longer vesting

As a MVP the vesting schedule is linear with 3 & 6 month vesting periods
Whilst the protocol ends up with its desired LP tokens => POL.

These become an income generating asset on the protocols balance sheet as this pool will generate market making revenues
